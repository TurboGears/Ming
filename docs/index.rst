=============================
Welcome to Ming Documentation
=============================

**Ming** is an Object Document Mapper (like an ORM but for Document based databases),
for MongoDB. Ming extends pymongo providing:

   * Declarative Models
   * Schema Validation and Conversion
   * Schema Evolution
   * Pure InMemory MongoDB Implementation
   * Unit of Work
   * Identity Map
   * One-To-Many, Many-To-One and Many-To-Many Relations

Getting Started
===============

To get started with Ming just install it with::

   $ pip install ming

Connecting to MongoDB
---------------------

Before we start, make sure you have a copy of MongoDB running.
First thing needed to start using Ming is to tell it how to connect to our instance of mongod.
For this we use the :func:`.create_datastore` function, this function creates a connection
to the MongoDB instance, replicaset or cluster specified by the given URL:

.. code-block:: python

    from ming import create_datastore
    from ming.odm import ThreadLocalODMSession

    session = ThreadLocalODMSession(
        bind=create_datastore('mongodb://myuser:mypassword@localhost:27017/odm_welcome')
    )

The :class:`.ThreadLocalODMSession` is the object all your models will use to interact with
MongoDB and can be directly used to perform low-level mongodb oprations.
While this provides no particular benefit over using *pymongo* directly
it already permits to create and query documents:

.. run-pysnippet:: ming_welcome snippet1

Using Models
------------

Now that we know how to connect to the Database we can declare models which will be
persisted on the database their session is associated to:

.. literalinclude:: src/ming_welcome.py
   :start-after: #{odm-model
   :end-before: #}

Models can be created by creating them and flushing their changes to the database.
A Model can then be queried back with the ``Model.query.find()`` method:

.. run-pysnippet:: ming_welcome snippet2

To start working with Ming continue with the :ref:`odm-introduction`
